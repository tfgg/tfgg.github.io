The MagresPython library
========================

MagresPython is a [Python](http://www.python.org/) library for parsing the [CCP-NC ab-initio magnetic resonance file format](http://www.ccpnc.ac.uk/pmwiki.php/CCPNC/Fileformat). This is used in the latest version of the [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org/) code, and is coming soon to other codes such as [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/).

It is open source and [available on the Github website](https://github.com/tfgg/magres-format).

It has been tested mostly on Linux (the Ubuntu distribution) and OS X.
