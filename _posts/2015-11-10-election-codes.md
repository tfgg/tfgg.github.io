title: Standard codes for UK elections
---

This is something that's been bumping around my head for a bit, and has come up quite a bit in chats around [Democracy Club](https://www.democracyclub.org.uk/) and civic technology generally. It's a very simple but, I'd say, necessary bit of infrastructure for UK elections online: <em>standardised codes for elections</em>.

## Why?

It's hard building websites like [YourNextMP](https://www.yournextmp.com) (crowdsourcing candidate info), or [MP CV](http://cv.democracyclub.org.uk/) (gathering CVs of candidates) to last for multiple elections. If you only target general elections in the UK you'll be waiting for five years to test your improvements! However, recently there's been more momentum to do so, as we've realised the benefits of being able to iterate over many elections, year-on-year. In 2016, [Democracy Club is planning on covering elections](https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2015/10/19/plans-for-2016/) of

- the Northern Irish Assembly
- the Welsh Assembly
- the Scottish Parliament
- Police and Crime Commissioners
- City Mayors

If our tools and sites are handling all these different elections, we need a unified way to refer to these different elections over all the different datasets and sites that are produced during an election. For example, a person's positions might be represented as

~~~javascript
{
    'candidacies': {
        'ge2010': {
            'party': 'Labour Party',
            'constituency': 'Oxford East',
        },
        'ge2015': {
            'party': 'Labour Party',
            'constituency': 'Oxford West',
        },
    }
}
~~~

Where the election key 'ge2010' lets you know everything you need to interpret the value.

You might be thinking, shouldn't this be some sort of official ISO proposal or something with committees? Yeah, probably, but the civic tech community is going to be actually using it and this post is intended to be the start of that conversation. As far as I know there's no existing standard. I'd love to hear of other examples of efforts at UK or international election codes, especially some official document I've completely missed!

Looking at the code for [elections in YourNextRepresentative](https://github.com/mysociety/yournextrepresentative/blob/master/elections/models.py) (n√©e YourNextMP), mySociety has a large number of fields, the most important seeming to be

- the date of the election
- the name of the election
- the role being vied for
- the areas covered

Looking at the [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/v2/elections), they just have

- an integer id for the election
- the name of the election
- the date of the election

I'm going to write another post with my proposal. Before I do that, and bias you, have a go at filling in the form below with what your idea of a good election code would be.

Thanks! I'll be following up soon, hopefully incorporating some of the feedback to this post. Comment below or <a href="https://twitter.com/tfgg2">tweet at me</a>.
